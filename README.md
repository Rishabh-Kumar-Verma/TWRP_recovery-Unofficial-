# TWRP_recovery-Unofficial-
A TWRP recovery ported for Coolpad Mega 3 device

PLS note that I shall not be held resbonsible for any damage which you would do to your device, So follow the steps with your full concentration....

this port is created by me to bring root abilitied to coolpad mega 3 device but because its in initial stage custom rom
flashing is not guaranteed and any further development are welcomed.

REQUIREMENT:
1. SP flash tool
2. Coolpad mega 3 device in switch off condition
3. magisk superuser zip file
4. adb and device drivers installed on the system.
5. Brave heart

INSTALLING THIS recovery:-

1. Download both the files and take a backup of your phone both system and user to prevent any backfires :)

2. now open SP flash tool and select scatter file which was downloaded earlier and select the recovery.img file (keep both the files together for hassleless process).

3. Now move the downloaded magisk superuser zip file to your phone/device.

4 Now, connect your device (switch it off before connecting), and wait for SP Flash tool to detect it. If it doesn't detect it you might have to install VCOM drivers for you mega 3 device.

5 Now, click on the download button on SP flash tool to begin flashing process.

6 on completion of this process CONGRATULATIONS!!! you have TWRP on your device but don't hype as few more configrations are needed to skip the recovery check pass.

7 Now boot into your recovery mode (not in system as doing the same would remove the custom recovry from the device)(learn it from internet if don't know how to boot into recovery).

8 PLS connect a mouse with otg cable as this recovery still doesn'y support SCREEN TOUCH. Swipe the bar with mouse pointer if greeted with some warning (accept the warning).

9 Now flash the magisk superuser zip file to disable recovery partition check or dm-verity issue.

10.Now reboot to system as TWRP is installed on your device.(if rebooting takes more than 10 minutes than you might have bricked your device, but don't worry internet would help you to fix that problem for you.)

CONGRATULATIONS!!!! TWRP and magisk has been istalled on your device install the magisk manager app and have fun.

BUGS:
1. Touch screen not supported.
3. Custom rom Flashing still not works because of certain partition checks on this 'highly secured device'. Moreover this device still doesn't have any custom rom support (DEVS PLS help). But device like mouse still work via otg :)

Except for these bugs all works fine like xposed, magisk, etc.

HAPPY MODDING........
